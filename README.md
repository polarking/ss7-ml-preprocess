# SS7 Machine Learning Preprocessing

## Introduction
Simple Apache Spark Streaming application used to preprocess SS7 network
traffic sent on Kafka. This application is designed to extract relevant
features from traffic generated by the [SS7 Attack
Simulator](https://github.com/polarking/jss7-attack-simulator).

The application reads data from the Kafka topic *ss7-raw-input* on localhost
and outputs to the Elasticsearch index *ss7-ml-preprocessed* and the Kafka
topic *ss7-preprocessed*.

## Instructions
It is a requirement that both Elasticsearch and Apache Kafka is running on
localhost. The application expects the following command line arguments:

1. URL of the Spark master. In the form spark://host:port.
2. Username for the Elasticsearch cluster.
3. Password for the Elasticsearch cluster.

The application can be started be using spark-submit:

```bash
bin/spark-submit \
  --class Main \
  --master spark://host:port \
  [application jar] \
  [Master URL] \
  [Elasticsearch username] \
  [Elasticsearch password]
```

## Build
The project uses sbt as its build tool. To compile the project use the assembly plugin:

```bash
sbt assembly
```

This creates a fat jar that resolves all dependencies required by Spark.
